Background & Overview

Private Capital Analytics (PCA) is a global private markets advisory and analytics firm specializing in custom investment solutions, performance reporting, and portfolio analysis for institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, and foundations. Iâ€™m working with the Investment Performance & Reporting Team to build a standardized quarterly performance report summarizing client portfolio NAV and IRR across all fund strategies. The goal is to flag declining IRR trends and significant NAV changes to support upcoming client meetings and internal performance reviews.

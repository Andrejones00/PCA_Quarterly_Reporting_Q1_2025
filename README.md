Background & Overview

Private Capital Analytics (PCA) is a global private markets advisory and analytics firm specializing in custom investment solutions, performance reporting, and portfolio analysis for institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, and foundations. I’m working with the Investment Performance & Reporting Team to build a standardized quarterly performance report summarizing client portfolio NAV and IRR across all fund strategies. The goal is to flag declining IRR trends and significant NAV changes to support upcoming client meetings and internal performance reviews.

Executive Summary

In Q1 2025, the portfolio posted a total NAV of $2.24B with an average IRR of 12.28%. Monitoring identified 21 client–fund records with quarter-over-quarter NAV changes of ±5% or more and 81 client–fund records with declining IRR, segmented by fund name and strategy (Private Equity, Credit, Venture Capital, Real Estate). Overall NAV trends were stable, with Private Equity delivering the highest average IRR, while Credit recorded the largest quarter-over-quarter IRR increase despite flat NAV performance. These results will be used to prioritize fund-level discussions with flagged clients and guide portfolio strategy reviews for the next quarter.

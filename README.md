Background & Overview

Private Capital Analytics (PCA) is a global private markets advisory and analytics firm specializing in custom investment solutions, performance reporting, and portfolio analysis for institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, and foundations. Iâ€™m working with the Investment Performance & Reporting Team to build a standardized quarterly performance report summarizing client portfolio NAV and IRR across all fund strategies. The goal is to flag declining IRR trends and significant NAV changes to support upcoming client meetings and internal performance reviews.

Prior to beginning the analysis, I conducted data cleaning and validation in MySQL to ensure NAV and IRR figures were accurate, consistent, and dashboard-ready. The SQL queries can be found "add link here and title it 'Here' "
